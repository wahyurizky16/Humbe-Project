<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Despite the stereotype of cats being irritable around other pets, they can learn to tolerate and even play with a variety of other animals. When cats are raised alongside birds, chickens, rats, dogs, and other animals, they develop a relationship together. It does take a little bit of work, though, and you may not see results for a few months - with persistence and everyday work, your pets will eventually get along and you&apos;ll wonder how it took so long for your cat to make a new friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(250, 197, 28);">Preparing Your Home And Cat For The Newcomer</span></strong></span></p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">1. Take note of your cats&apos; territorial tendencies, for example marking its scent</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Before you begin to think about getting a new pet, get a good understanding of how territorial a cat behaves. If it marks its territory very often in many different places throughout the day, you can expect that it may take some time for it to get used to a new companion sharing the space. If a cat sort of lays around and doesn&apos;t feel the need to spray its pheromones constantly, you can expect the introduction process to go much more smoothly.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If a cat tends to act aggressively when its territory is invaded, e.g. by your other cats, then you may need to prepare to deal with its aggression towards the new pet by buying a spray bottle.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(250, 197, 28);">2. Set Aside Two Separate Rooms To Keep Your Cats And New Pet In</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">At first, you should always keep the new pet away from your cats, as when you aren&apos;t around to supervise their interactions fighting can break out. Set up a room for your cats with a litter box, toys, food, and water, and set up another room in another area of the house for your new pet with their needs satisfied as well.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Over time, your pets will gradually get used to each other&apos;s scent, but cats do not like change and will usually react negatively to a new companion if not properly introduced slowly.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Keep a small pet in your room, if it is not too loud, to keep an eye on it during the night, but keep your cats in a different room at all times until they have adjusted to each other&apos;s presence.</span></li>
</ol>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">3. Choose A New Pet That Fits Your Cat&apos;s Level Of Activity</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If a cat is very young and playful, a young puppy or an energetic flightless bird, such as a young duck, may be good options. If a cat is lazy and doesn&apos;t run around much, it will probably be fine with a larger pet or even with rodents and large lizards - although cats are notably terrified by snakes and will likely never get along.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Think about your new pet&apos;s needs as well. If you want to get an old dog or cat, it may not be very friendly towards a jumpy and curious kitten. If you want to get a fish, you must keep its aquarium covered to prevent a curious cat from going for a swim.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">1. Keep The Animals In Separate Rooms For A Week, Alternating Being Out</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Before you bring the new pet home, put your cats in the room you designated for it, and shut the door. Once the new pet has come home with you, keep it in its own room without the cats until your cats get used to its scent. You should keep the cats in its room when the new pet is out, and keep the new pet in its room when you let the cats out. It is useful to keep the new pet in your bedroom so that you can let your cats out at night and let your new pet out during the day. This will get your pets adjusted to each other&apos;s smell as they will unknowingly be sharing the same spaces, albeit at different times.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(250, 197, 28);">2. Feed Your Cats And The New Pet On Each Side Of A Door</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">When your cats are in the room and the new pet is out and getting used to the home, feed it directly next to the door leading to the cat&apos;s room.Your cats&apos; food should be placed near the door as well so they are forced to eat nearby the new pet.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If your new pet is small enough to fit under the door, like say a rodent or small reptile, instead move the cage close to the door while your cats are confined so its scent will get through the door without risking the new pet getting attacked.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">This associated the smell of the new pet with food, which the cats will then associate with good things and rewards.</span></li>
</ol>
<div align="center"><br></div>

    <div align="center"><br></div>
        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 168, 133);">3. Rub A Washcloth On The New Pet And Leave It With Your Cats In The Room.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The washcloth will absorb a lot of the scent of the new pet, which can then be left in the cats&apos; room so it can investigate the smells. Do the reverse as well, so your new pet can get used to the cats&apos; scent.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">In animals, smells mean a lot more than appearances. If the cats and new pet are used to each other&apos;s scents, they will be a lot less likely to start fighting or act aggressively and territorial.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Consider leaving some loose skin from a new reptile pet, if it has any, in the cat&apos;s room so it can smell new animal directly. Washcloths may not work as well on reptiles as they do not create as much oil on their skin as mammals.</span></li>
</ol>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">4. Prop The Door Open Very Slightly So Your Cats Can See The New Pet</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Open the door a crack so neither pet can escape into another room, and let your cats get a look at the new pet. While smells mean a lot more than appearances, cats can sometimes get scared by large dogs or can get enticed by a small rabbit or rodent.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Small animals that could get through the door should be kept in the cage while you introduce them to the cats visually, so they don&apos;t escape and risk getting attacked.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Let your pets get a look at each other over the course of a few days before you let them meet each other directly. This will let them get used to each other&apos;s presence and appearance, so that the eventual face to face meeting will go more smoothly.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Don&apos;t open the door any more than a crack, no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm), so neither pet can attack or reach the other.</span></li>
</ol>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(147, 101, 184);">5. Supervise The Pets Together In The Same Room, And Use Food To Distract Them</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">After a week or two, let your pets meet each other in a neutral room. A bathroom is a good place, as there are few places to hide and you can easily keep an eye on the pets.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Set up a tall gate or close the door behind you to ensure that the pets have to meet and get to know each other.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Handle the new pet and show the cats that you accept it, which can help it to understand that the new pet is neither an enemy nor prey &mdash; at least while you are supervising.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Small pets should be kept in their cage so they don&apos;t run and hide under a counter or try to evade the cat. Dogs and large animals are fine to keep out, but rodents and other small animals may try to escape in panic rather than get used to the cat&apos;s presence.</span></li>
</ol>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">6. Use Toys And Food To Make The Pets Play And Eat Together In The Same Room</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If your new animal likes to play, like say a dog or a large rodent, bring one toy in there that it will have to share with the cats. Feed the animals under your supervision in the same room to reduce anxiety between the pets and to make them associate feeding with each other&apos;s presence.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">You don&apos;t have to feed them right next to each other, if there is some level of animosity. Even feeding them in separate corners of the same room will help your pets to associate the good feeling of eating with the other pet&apos;s scent.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">This is especially effective with puppies and kittens, as they will learn to associate playing with their favorite toys by playing with each other, reducing animosity between the stereotypically opposite pets.</span></li>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(250, 197, 28);">7. Let The Animals Have Free Reign Of The Home, After A Few Weeks</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Only after you are sure that the pets get along should you let them have free reign of the home. Still keep an eye on the cats and the new pet, though, as territorial behaviour can still come up if the new pet happens to find one of the cats&apos; safe spaces, as it were.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Small pets should still be kept in their cage, but over time start to introduce them to the cats holding them in your hands out of the cage. Always supervise your cat&apos;s interactions with small pets, and use a cage with tight enough bars that it can&apos;t attack your new pet through the grating.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Buy a new bed or another special place for your new pet to lay in and make its own to prevent it from taking over areas that the cats often use.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Continue to feed your pets together and offer treats when your pets behave around each other.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Until a few months have passed, tensions can still flare up and your pets can still become aggressive towards each other. For the first few months, try to keep a close eye on how your pets are acting around each other and quickly respond to any yelps or cries you hear if you&apos;re in another room.</span></p>
<div align="center"><br></div>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(250, 197, 28);">2. Look For Signs Of Aggression In Your Cats And In The New Pet</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Signs of aggression in cats include rearing up, hissing, marking their territory more often, and even sudden, stealthy attacks. Look up signs of aggression in your other pets as pertains to its species - a monitor lizard will react much differently in aggression than a dog will, for example. Generally, an animal will appear aggressive if it shows its teeth, rears up to make itself larger, or its hair will stand on end. Be sure to look out for signs of aggression in your specific pet, though, as it varies quite a lot.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Squirt bottles are the most effective and most common way to control a cat&apos;s behaviour. If your cats are acting particularly rough with your new pet, spray it a few times with water to irritate it and it will leave the scene. Only use regular tap water or purified water, as anything else could harm your cat&apos;s eyes and skin.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">A good alternative is to bang a pan or make a loud noise near the cats to scare them into running away. Never hit your cats or try to break them up by hand or you could get scratched.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">On the other hand, if your cats are behaving well around the new pet, give it special treats like fresh fish and chicken to reinforce its good behaviour.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The best way to prevent fights is to avoid letting your pets have any physical contact. If your cats or new pet are acting aggressively, separate them into their confined rooms for a few hours, then slowly re-introduce them under your supervision.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If the problem is particularly bad and the cats simply do not want to accept the new pet, consider taking the aggressive cats to a vet to see if it has behavioural issues, as most cats will accept a new companion within a few months.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Repeat the process of slow introduction again if your pets still don&apos;t get along.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Cats are predators by nature and have the instinct to hunt smaller animals. If you have any doubt on whether or not you can trust your cat alone with other animals, don&rsquo;t leave them unsupervised.</span></li>
