<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">You may find that you don&apos;t need to brush or groom their fur, as cats can bathe themselves. However, you still need to comb long-haired cats a few times a week, or once a week for short-haired cats. This way, you can prevent hair loss and prevent the formation of hairballs on the cat&apos;s body. For cats that tend to shed a lot (especially long-haired species), use a comb that has fine metal teeth. A comb like this can go into deeper layers and reduce hair loss.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">like any member of your family, cats also need medical visits. However, unlike children, cats cannot tell us when they are feeling sick. He relies on humans to be taken to the veterinarian and get periodic medical examinations to maintain his health. It is important that you take him to the vet at least once a year so that he can get a physical exam (eg teeth, ears, eyes, heart), vaccinations and anti-flea / worm treatment. All cat owners are advised to vaccinate against feline enteritis (feline infectious enteritis or FIE), cat flu and cat leukemia virus (feline leukemia virus or FeLV). All of these diseases can kill the cat if it becomes infected so it is important that you protect it. Some cat care centers also may not accept your cat without evidence of the above vaccinations (or other vaccinations). The vet can quickly suggest which vaccinations your pussy needs. If you are concerned about his health or behavior, take your pussy to the vet as soon as possible. Older cats may need to be taken to the vet twice a year for optimal health.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Like human babies, kittens should be brought to the vet more often than adult cats. From about 8 weeks of age, cats need 2-3 visits to the vet for vaccinations and anti-worm treatment. At the very least, a visit to the veterinarian includes administering the distemper or rabies vaccines.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The doctor can also discuss the benefits of additional vaccinations. Ask about the risk of several types of diseases such as cat leukemia, and make wise decisions about which vaccinations to give.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The doctor can also check the cat for fleas or ear mites and treat it if necessary.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Make sure the cat is getting anti-worm treatment. Most kittens have roundworms that can inhibit growth and possibly transfer to humans.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Sterilizing a female or male cat has many positive benefits, such as reducing unwanted behavior (eg hanging around and blowing urine on items). Physically, the sterilization also protects the cat from unwanted pregnancies and diseases such as pyometra. Most importantly, sterilization helps reduce the world&apos;s unwanted kitten population.&nbsp;Ask your vet for advice on when to sterilize kittens. In general, veterinarians usually recommend sterilization at 2-6 months of age.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Cats can experience dental problems. To brush his teeth, you need a soft-bristled toothbrush and special toothpaste. Never use human toothpaste! The fluoride content that is too high can trigger irritation in the cat&apos;s stomach. With the high concentration of fluoride in human toothpaste, excess doses can be toxic to cats. Start by giving him some toothpaste from the vet. After that, let him taste it himself, then rub your finger on the top gum. Repeat this process with a toothbrush. Glue the bristles along the gum line on the back of the upper teeth, then tilt the brush a little so that the bristles hit the bottom of the gum line. Clean the teeth from the back to the front in a circular motion around the gum line. The process of brushing your cat&apos;s teeth takes less than 30 seconds.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Don&apos;t immediately try to brush its entire mouth. If the cat only allows you to brush the outside of its upper teeth, at least this is better than nothing. You can still handle the most important things to prevent dental disease.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(250, 197, 28);">7. Schedule Professional Dental Cleaning If Necessary</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Even if you brush their teeth well, sometimes cats still need professional brushing. Tooth brushing helps reduce visible plaque and dirt buildup on the surface of the teeth, but it may not be able to reach food debris that is left below the gum line. Professional brushing gives the doctor the opportunity to thoroughly examine the pussy&apos;s mouth (the cat will be sedated first). Some signs of dental disease in cats include :</span></p>
<ol>
    <li>Bad breath</li>
    <li>Loose teeth</li>
    <li>Discoloration of teeth or teeth coated with tartar</li>
    <li>Oral sensitivity or pain</li>
    <li>Bleeding</li>
    <li>Salivating a lot or dropping food frequently while eating</li>
    <li>Decreased appetite for food or weight</li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your cat needs to interact with you every day to stay happy and physically fit. Use a cat toy, chat with her, and brush her fur to spend time together. Small laser lights, balls, mouse-shaped toys, and fur toys are great media to invite him to play.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">1. Decide whether you want to have a kitten or an adult cat</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Kittens may be seductive, but make sure that you can adapt to the cat&apos;s energy levels and take appropriate responsibilities. Animal shelters have lots of adorable adult cats who may have a hard time getting their &quot;parents&quot; to foster. Adult cats are usually calmer and more reserved than kittens, but may still carry behavioral problems from their previous lives. Additionally, adult cats may have medical conditions that you need to treat as soon as possible than kittens. On the other hand, kittens sometimes scratch violently. Therefore, determine whether you are prepared for the consequences for each choice.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If you like cats, for example, ask about their medical history to see if they need long-term care. Think about whether you are financially able to meet his medical needs.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Even though he looks healthy, consider the species. Native cats of different species have their own genetic problems. For example, flat-faced cats such as the Manx and Scottish Fold often experience respiratory problems</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Native cats are at a higher risk of genetic medical disorders than cats of mixed breeds.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">While the cat doesn&apos;t need to be walked around every day like a dog, don&apos;t be fooled into thinking that cats (and kittens) don&apos;t need a time commitment from you. Cats are still active animals that need frequent play, and are sweet companions who often demand attention. You also need to take the time to clean the litter box and provide structured food. The average lifespan of a pet cat is 13-17, so be aware that you need to make a long-term commitment to the cat.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The cost of buying a cat ranges from (approximately) 500 thousand rupiah from an animal adoption center / shelter to millions of rupiah for a real breed cat. In addition, you need to spend money on food, liters, toys and periodic medication. The United States Association for the Prevention of Violence against Animals or the ASPCA estimates that in the first year of raising a cat, you will need to spend about $ 1,035, or about $ 14 million.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">These costs are likely to be reduced once you purchase the main kit and your cat goes through the initial medical procedures.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Biaya yang perlu dikeluarkan cukup terjangkau jika dibandingkan keuntungan yang bisa Anda dapatkan: vaksinasi lengkap, pemeriksaan kesehatan, dan pensterilan. However, keep in mind that even the cats you can get &quot;for free&quot; will eventually require maintenance costs (if you are really responsible).</span></p>
