<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">You feel like you are at your wit&rsquo;s end because your cat just won&rsquo;t stop scratching your furniture, urinating outside of her/his litter box, or doing some other undesirable behavior. You may be willing to try anything to get the bad behavior to stop, but it is important to realize that there are right ways and wrong ways to discipline your cat. You will need to discipline your cat in ways that will not only stop the bad behavior, but also keep your bond with her strong and intact.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">As much you might want to think that your cat is doing something bad simply out of spite, there may be a medical or behavioral reason why she&rsquo;s doing what you don&rsquo;t want her to do. For example, your cat may be going outside of the litter box because of a urinary problem (urinary tract infection, kidney disease) that keeps her from making it to the litter box in time. Your veterinarian will be able to determine if a medical problem is the root cause of the undesirable behavior. But also remember your cat may have a anxiety problem.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Pica is a medical issue that involves eating or chewing on inedible objects, like plastic or cardboard. If your cat is chewing on or eating unusual things, it may be a sign of dental or gastrointestinal disease.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Dementia could be causing your cat to cry at night.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Medical issues should be ruled out before behavioral issues are considered.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">your veterinarian has been able to rule out medical causes of bad behavior, then it is time to start looking more closely at your cat&rsquo;s behavior. One behavioral cause of bad behavior in cats is stress. Cats do not adjust well to change (new house, new pet, new baby), so changes in their environment can easily stress them out, causing them to scratch furniture, spray urine, etc.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your cat may be acting out if she&rsquo;s bored. If your cat does not have enough toys to play with or doesn&rsquo;t get the attention she wants from you, she may find other things to do out of boredom, like tearing up toilet paper. Keep in mind that she probably does not realize that the behavior is wrong; she&rsquo;s simply doing something to keep her busy.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your cat may misbehave if she hasn&rsquo;t been properly trained. Although cats are typically very smart, they still need to be trained to do the right thing. If she has not been trained, she will not know what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong and will essentially do as she pleases.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Keep in mind that behaviors you may consider acting out - such as scratching furniture, just to sharpen their claws - are simply a normal part of cat behavior. Instead of punishment, you might think about ways to provide the cat with a more appropriate outlet for that behavior, such as providing multiple scratch posts.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Make sure you are providing your cat with an interesting, enriching environment. Puzzle feeders, scratch posts, toys, climbing towers, and engaging in active play every day are all ways your cat can redirect the behavior.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">4. Familiarize Yourself With How Cats Learn</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">How cats learn is a simple concept: they repeat experiences that are good and avoid the experiences that are bad.[7] It is very important to remember that cats do not learn by punishment. Instead of teaching her that what she is doing is wrong, punishment will leave your cat feeling confused and fearful. She will probably want to avoid you, which will weaken your bond with her.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(147, 101, 184);">5. Learn What Disciplinary Actions Will Not Work</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">As just mentioned, punishment will not get your cat to stop the bad behavior. Yelling and hitting your cat are forms of punishment that you should never use to discipline her. In addition, using a spray water bottle is generally frowned upon as a way to discipline cats, although many cat owners use it.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Although you may think that spraying water on your cat will deter her from the bad behavior, she is actually learning to perform that behavior when you are not around. Use of the spray bottle can also make her fearful and wary of you.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Rubbing your cat&rsquo;s nose in her urine if she goes outside of her litterbox is an ineffective disciplinary method. It actually reminds her of a good spot to go to the bathroom.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Scruffing should not be used as punishment. It can be a method to disrupt bad behavior, but is not an effective method to punish your cat.</span></li>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">1. Bond With Your Cat In Fun And Rewarding Ways</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">It may not seem like bonding with your cat will help stop her bad behavior, but the extra attention and playtime may divert your cat&rsquo;s energy away from misbehaving. One of the goals of increasing your bonding time is to decrease the negative reprimands and punishments that you may be giving her. The more that she enjoys your company and trusts you, the less likely she will misbehave because of stress or boredom. In addition to playing with her more, you can also try giving her massages.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(250, 197, 28);">2. Make The Bad Behavior Undesirable Or Impossible</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Since cats learn by avoiding an experience that has a negative result, you want to attach a negative association to whichever bad behavior she is doing. For example, if she is scratching your sofa, you would discipline her by making the sofa difficult to scratch. Putting double-sided tape or aluminum foil on the sofa are helpful deterrents.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Making aspects of her environment undesirable when you are not around is called &lsquo;environmental punishment.&rsquo;</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If your cat likes to jump on the countertops or table, try balancing a cookie sheet or baking sheet on the edge of those surfaces. When she jumps up, the baking or cookie sheet will fall to the floor and make a loud noise. She won&rsquo;t like the loud noise, and landing on an uneven surface will throw off her balance. Eventually, she will learn not to jump up where she&rsquo;s not supposed to.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If your cat keeps on eating your plants or urinating in the soil, make the plant undesirable by spraying bitter apple or bitter orange on the plant leaves. You can also cover the dirt with aluminum foil or gravel.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Commercially available deterrent devices can also make bad behavior undesirable. Examples of these devices include upside-down mousetraps that spring into the air when touched and motion-activated devices that spray a blast of compressed air. These devices are available at your local pet store and are useful to keep your cat from going into areas where she is not allowed.</span></li>

        <p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">3. Make The Good Behavior Extremely Rewarding</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The more positive reinforcement your give your cat for doing the right thing, the more likely she is to repeat the good behavior. For example, when you see her using her scratching post instead of scratching your furniture, reward her with extra playtime, verbal praise or edible treats. Make sure to reward her while she is doing the good behavior, rather than afterwards, or she may not understand what she is being rewarded for.</span></p></font></span></h2>
