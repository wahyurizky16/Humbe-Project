<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">One of the things you need to do to be a good cat owner is to take care of your pet cat&apos;s needs, such as providing high-quality drinking water and food, providing a warm and comfortable place to sleep, and taking him to the vet for annual visits. However, when getting a cat you don&apos;t just have to do these things. By pampering your cat, you can strengthen your relationship with him. You can also get creative (and try to spend a bigger budget) to provide maintenance on top of the basics.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">1. Develop A Habit Of Combing His Fur</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The cat will be delighted with the rhythmic movements when you comb the fur from front to back. Apart from pampering it, this kind of brushing also provides several benefits, such as stimulating the skin, cleansing the hair, spreading natural oils throughout the hair, and preventing frizz.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">If you have never brushed or brushed his fur before, do a short brushing session first (5-10 minutes). You can extend the amount of time that the pussy starts to feel comfortable with the brushing you are doing.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Cats may have their own preferences regarding the type of comb they prefer. Because of this, you may need to try different types of combs (eg bristles, slippery brushes, etc.) to find out which type of comb / brush he likes best.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Comb the fur when both of you are relaxed. If you are feeling stressed, or the cat is feeling tense, the grooming session will be less enjoyable for either of you</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Short-haired cats require less brushing (once a week) than long-haired cats (once a day).</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Be careful when combing the hair on the chest and belly.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Cats enjoy their peace and quiet. Sharing some quiet time with her can be enjoyable and relaxing for the both of you. Try gently petting her when she is resting peacefully in your lap. Just be sure not to pet her belly your cat may interpret this as an attack and respond by trying to swing at or bite you.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your cat loves to sleep! You can spoil her by providing her with comfortable places to sleep throughout your home. Ideally, these places should be in quiet areas of your home that do not have many distractions. Set up the sleeping area with comfortable bedding, such as a cat bed or mat. You can purchase these at your local pet store.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">4. Provide Your Cat With Multiple Scratching Posts</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Scratching is an important aspect of your cat&rsquo;s overall health-it keeps her nails filed down, gives her exercise, and allows her to stretch her muscles.&nbsp;Giving her multiple areas where she can scratch will make your cat happy and can keep her busy when you are not able to play with her.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Consider purchasing scratching posts with different textures (sisal, corrugated cardboard, carpeted) and orientations (horizontal and vertical). This will add variety to your cat&rsquo;s scratching activities.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Place the scratching posts in areas where your cat likes to frequent to decrease the distance she has to go to scratch.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">The scratching posts should be sturdy, as well as tall or long enough (about 2 feet) for her to stretch out her entire body when she scratches.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Do not throw away the scratching post when you think it looks too old and worn. That is actually just the way your cat wants it.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Cat trees are another fun way to spoil your cat. You can find these at your local pet store.</span></li>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(147, 101, 184);">5. Give Your Cat Plenty Of Toys To Play With</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Giving your cat a toy or two to play with will not be sufficient to spoil her. Rather, you should give her what seems like a never-ending supply of toys. Fortunately, you do not have to spend a fortune simply rotate the toys out on a regular basis (about once a week) so that she doesn&rsquo;t become used to any one toy for long.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">To stimulate her natural instinct to hunt, try hiding the toys in different places of your home</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">To add a new twist to her playtime, download some cat-friendly games on your tablet that your cat can play.</span></li>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65);">6. Add creativity to your playtime with your cat.</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your cat can certainly entertain herself, but she still needs plenty of interaction with you. Getting creative during her playtime can make the experience fun and enjoyable for both of you. For example, hide behind your couch and poke your head around the corner until she sees you. Immediately go back into &lsquo;hiding&rsquo; and wait for her to stealthily come up next to you this activity mimics her hunting for prey.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">You can also dim the lights during her playtime to mimic her natural tendency to be active in the dark</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Aim to play with her for about 10 to 15 minutes twice a day.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">A simple way to make this happen is to place comfortable perches in your home&rsquo;s windows. Depending on the view from your home, your cat could be entertained for hours by looking out of the window. If you have a yard, place a bird feeder or bird bath in your yard so that your cat can watch birds come and go. You can also put in a cat video for your cat to watch when you are not home. These videos can feature a cat&rsquo;s typical prey (rodents and birds)</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">8. Give your cat the occasional tasty treat</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Treats are a great way to spoil your cat. However, you should not give your cat treats every day for several reasons. First, many cat treats provide little to no nutritional value. Secondly, giving your cat treats every day may cause her to like her treats more than her regular food.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Feed your cat treats no more frequently than two to three times per week.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Do not treat your cat with human food.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Catnip and cat grass are healthy cat treats and can be found at your local pet store.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Do not allow your cat to beg for treats. This is bad behavior and should not be rewarded with food or extra attention.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Senior cats can have a difficult time getting around, which means that they may have trouble walking to their litter box. In addition, older cats can develop urinary tract problems that may make it challenging to get to the litter box in time. Placing litter boxes in the places where your cat spends most of her time will help prevent accidental urination or defecation. Litter boxes with low walls are easier for a senior cat to step into and out of.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">In addition to decreased mobility, your senior cat may also be losing her vision and hearing. Because of this, she may start to feel insecure in her ability to navigate her environment. By maintaining her consistent schedule of feeding and playtime, you can help her feel safer and more comfortable in her environment.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Massaging your senior cat can help loosen her stiff muscles and joints and stimulate her blood circulation. In addition, massaging her can help her feel more connected to you something that is very important to older cats. Also, massaging your senior cat gives you an opportunity to gently examine her all over and identify lumps and bumps that may require closer examination by your veterinarian.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Be gentle when you massage your cat.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">To massage your cat, make small circles with your fingers. Start behind her ears and slowly work your way down her neck. Continue to massage her down her back.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Make sure to avoid massaging areas that may be painful for your cat.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">With potentially stiff muscles and joints, your senior cat may not be able to groom herself as well as she used to. Be sure to use a soft brush when you brush her, since the skin of older cats is more sensitive than a younger cat&rsquo;s skin.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Trim your senior cat&rsquo;s nails if she will let you. Her nails may need to be trimmed more frequently (every few weeks) if she cannot use the scratching post as much as she used to. Trim her nails to just above the quick-the blood vessel that runs up the middle of her nail.</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Cat&rsquo;s nails tend to curve under towards the foot pad when they grow too long, which would be very uncomfortable for your cat. Begin trimming her nails when you notice that she can no longer use the scratching post to prevent her nails from growing too long.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your senior cat has different nutritional needs than a younger cat. When she is 7 to 9 years old, begin transitioning her over to a senior cat diet from an adult maintenance diet. This will help ensure she receives the proper balance of nutrients.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Transition to the new diet over 5 days: day 1 (20% new diet, 80% old diet), day 2 (40% new diet, 60% old diet), day 3 (60% new diet, 40% old diet), day 4 (80% new diet, 20% old diet), day 5 (100% new diet).</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Depending on your senior cat&rsquo;s medical condition, she may also need dietary supplements (e.g., probiotics, fatty acids).</span></li>
    <li style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Consult with your veterinarian before making any changes to your cat&rsquo;s diet.</span></li>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Your senior cat will definitely appreciate some extra padding when she sleeps. In addition to achy joints, your senior cat may have also lost some muscle mass that would make sleep very uncomfortable.</span></p>
